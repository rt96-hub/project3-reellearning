**Summary of Our Conversation**

We discussed strategies to implement a recommendation system that leverages:
- A **one-hot** embedding (structured tags) for each video and user/class profile.
- Free-form **hashtags** for unstructured or user-added labeling.

**Key Points**:
1. **One-Hot Tagging**  
   - Maintain a curated list of official tags (e.g., ["math_algebra", "math_calculus", ...]).  
   - Each video holds a binary vector indicating which tags it has.  
   - Each user (or class) accumulates these tags by counting how often they engage (like, comprehend) with videos containing those tags.

2. **Hashtags**  
   - Allow free-form or user-added tags (e.g., "#funmath").  
   - Store them separately from the official tag vector.  

3. **Similarity Logic**  
   - Compute **cosine similarity** on the one-hot vectors between the user (or class) profile and candidate videos.  
   - Add a secondary "overlap score" for any matching hashtags.  
   - Final recommendation score can be a weighted combination:  
     ```
       score = α · (cosine similarity) + β · (hashtag overlap)
     ```

4. **Implementation Tips**:
   - For smaller data sets, query videos in real time using Firestore's `array_contains_any` on official tags, then post-process for final ranking in your server.  
   - For larger scale, **precompute** a list of recommended video IDs for each user/class in a background job (e.g., a scheduled Cloud Function), storing them under something like `recommendations/{userId}`.

5. **Example**:
   ```
   # Pseudocode for computing user preference vector
   user_pref = { "math_algebra": 0, "math_calculus": 0, "physics_mechanics": 0, ... }
   for each liked_video in userLikes[userId]:
       for tag in liked_video.officialTags:
           user_pref[tag] += 1

   # Convert to a normalized vector for similarity calculations
   ```

This approach allows you to **combine** a curated taxonomy (one-hot vector) with **flexible hashtags**, providing a solid foundation for your recommendation system.
