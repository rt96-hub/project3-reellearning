x track watched videos
- preload videos/stream
    - store download of prior x videos so you can go back??
- refactor?
x generate fake video data
    x name, description
    x tags
    x fake transcript
    x ai gen analysis of transcript and otherwise
- tag videos with subject
    - tag classes/feeds with interests and understanding
    - BASIC recommendation system from get videos
x generate video files
    x 10 seconds of video (same dimensions as my phone videos)
    x lower quality
    x just the title and description
    - make a thumbnail
- tag classes with subject too?
x build and deploy
x email verification on deployed??????

x script to remove # from all tags
    x videos.classification.explicit.hashtags
    x videoTags.tag
    x videoTags.relatedTags

- general recommendation system
    x create a vector for each video
    - when a video is liked for a user/class, 
        - it adds the vector to the user/class vector
        - it adds the tags to the user/class tag preferences map
    - when we call the load videos function, we do a combined scoring approach
        - score = alpha * vector similarity + beta * tag similarity
        - vector similarity is the cosine similarity between the user/class vector and the video vector
        - tag similarity is the cosine similarity between the user/class tag preferences and the video tags



- ai
    - ai generated onboarding??? (GOTTA BE FAST THO)
        x how does this seed the data?
        x get a list of the 20 most common tags, when you select a tag, it gets 5 more tags related to it, recursively
        x create an embedding of the tags, and when you select a tag, it gets the top 5 tags related to it (we can precalculate the 5 nearest neighbors and store them)
        x create a tag table, and when a new video is uploaded, if the tag doesn't exist, it creates it, otherwise it increments the count
        - eventually, we will run a nightly job to calculate the 5 nearest neighbors for all tags
        x these tags will be part of the recommendation system, basically looking at the users most liked tags and recommending videos within those and related tags
    - add similar onboarding when you create a class
        - maybe with a search?
    - ai generated progress report(what have you done over the last x days)
    - ai generated class report for curators (what have the students been liking/comprehending)
    - ai generated questions randomly in the feed, based on last x videos watched (depends on subject)
    - ai generated badges or achievements???

        - badges/achievements page (NFT???)
    


- eventually
    - search
    - dms
    - notifications
    - auto binary classification on video upload
