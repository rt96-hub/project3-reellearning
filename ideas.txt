learning app
- user sees videos, tailored to their level/interests
- users can make lists with specific topics
- users can engage with other users in chats about specific videos or creators
- users can generate progress reports, or suggestions for what to learn next (or does app just do this?)
- users can set goals, and the app will suggest content accordingly
