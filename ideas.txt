learning app
- user sees videos, tailored to their level/interests
- users can make lists with specific topics
- users can engage with other users in chats about specific videos or creators
- users can generate progress reports, or suggestions for what to learn next (or does app just do this?)
- users can set goals, and the app will suggest content accordingly
- users can join classes or clubs, and maybe this is similar to lists, but with more generalized topics
- users can mark videos as not understood, partially understood, or fully understood, and the app will suggest more content accordingly
    - this needs to be relevant to the specific type of content they are watching, math or history comprehesion shouldn't be directly related
- no phone rotate
- login/signup page has a background of equations and other educational text floating across the background



The user's login info/status needs to be stored on the device so they can be logged in when they reopen
implement the back drag gesture for navigation(maybe not)
when the app is minimized, it stays on the page when they reopen

x validate email is correct format
- add email verification
- prevent login if email is not verified
- validate phone number is correct format


bottom bar should be:
- feed
    - how does the video need to be formatted, how do we display different resolutions/filetypes?
    - sidebar of comments, bookmarked, liked, etc
        - comments:
            - comments open up a bottom half modal, highly liked comments go to the topic
            - comments can be liked, bookmarked, etc
        - likes:
            - when liked, brings up a modal of all the classes you have made
            - you can select any number of classes (or none for a general like) to like the video for
            - show liked videos on profile? so we can remove them if a user wants to
            - will train the algorithm to show more in those classes
        - bookmarked:
            - saves for later in user profile
        - share:
            - either other users or classes(?)
            - copy link
    - tap profile to open users profile
    - description to expand the text
    - three buttons on the bottom (like tinder):
        - don't understand
        - partially understand
        - fully understand
    - slide the screen down to see more videos
        - repeat
        - forever


- messages
    - chat with other users
    - can be grouped into a chat room

- classes
    - individually created
        - essentially a tailored algorithm that finds videos relevant to the topic (math, chem, etc)
        - can be public or private
            - either joinable or invitable
    - when anyone whos part of the class opens it, it brings them to that video feed
        - maybe one button to open, one is a big chat channel
    - classes page:
        - name, creator, description, join button
        - can still see feed maybe?


- profile
    - name, pfp, description, etc
    - posted videos
    - classes created
    - classes joined
    - follow/block buttons (if you are not the user)
    - settings (if you are the user)

- maybe include a search bar for classes, users, videos, etc
