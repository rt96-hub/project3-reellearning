learning app
- user sees videos, tailored to their level/interests
- users can make lists with specific topics
- users can engage with other users in chats about specific videos or creators
- users can generate progress reports, or suggestions for what to learn next (or does app just do this?)
- users can set goals, and the app will suggest content accordingly
- users can join classes or clubs, and maybe this is similar to lists, but with more generalized topics
- users can mark videos as not understood, partially understood, or fully understood, and the app will suggest more content accordingly
    - this needs to be relevant to the specific type of content they are watching, math or history comprehesion shouldn't be directly related
- no phone rotate
- login/signup page has a background of equations and other educational text floating across the background



The user's login info/status needs to be stored on the device so they can be logged in when they reopen
implement the back drag gesture for navigation(maybe not)
when the app is minimized, it stays on the page when they reopen

x validate email is correct format
- add email verification
- prevent login if email is not verified
- validate phone number is correct format


bottom bar should be:
- feed
    - how does the video need to be formatted, how do we display different resolutions/filetypes?
    - sidebar of comments, bookmarked, liked, etc
        x comments:
            x comments open up a bottom half modal, highly liked comments go to the topic
            x comments can be liked 
            - comments can be bookmarked
            - comments can be replied to
        - likes:
            - when liked, brings up a modal of all the classes you have made
            - you can select any number of classes (or none for a general like) to like the video for
            - show liked videos on profile? so we can remove them if a user wants to
            - will train the algorithm to show more in those classes
        - bookmarked:
            - saves for later in user profile
            - save in a particular class or general? similar to likes
            - stores in a separate collection with the joint, or is it a sub collection of videoIds in like users.bookmarks....
        - share:
            - either other users or classes(?)
            - copy link
    - tap profile to open users profile
    - description to expand the text
    x three buttons on the bottom (like tinder):
        x don't understand
        x partially understand
        x fully understand
        - make the understanding schema to allow these to be tracked
    x slide the screen down to see more videos
        x repeat
        - forever (do infinite/random stuff)
        - some kind of find next video(s) function in firebase???


- messages
    - chat with other users
    - can be grouped into a chat room

- classes
    - classes page
        - three tabs:
            - classes you are a creator of
            - classes you are in
            - discover public classes
    - individually created
        - essentially a tailored algorithm that finds videos relevant to the topic (math, chem, etc)
        - can be public or private

            - either joinable or invitable
    - when anyone whos part of the class opens it, it brings them to that video feed
        - maybe one button to open, one is a big chat channel
    - classes page:
        - name, creator, description, join button
        - can still see feed maybe?
        - members list popout
            - curator first
            - then members
            - can click any member to go to their profile


- video attributes to flesh out:
    - title
    - description
    - tags
    - thumbnail
    - (tags for now, eventually generate topics and subtopics, and level of difficulty)
    - (or the above tags are suggested when you upload a video and the AI scans it)
    

- profile
    - how to navigate to another users profile?
        - from icon/name on video feed
        - from class members list
        - from search
        - from comments
        - from messages
    x name, pfp, description, etc
    - posted videos
        - grid like view
    - classes created
    - classes joined
    - connect/block buttons (if you are not the user)
    - settings (if you are the user)

x maybe include a search page
    - for classes
    - for users
    - for videos

- different video feed types
    - main feed
    - class specific feed
    - own user bookmarked videos
    - own user liked videos
    - user created videos (from any users profile/video page)
    - class bookmarked videos

- going back to the home screen doesnt reset the feed

- different video formats??
    - mp4
    - webm
    - what do phones record


- ai enhancements:
    - ai can generate report cards for a user, based on their activity over a period of time
    - for a curator of a class, the ai can aggregate the activity of users in the class to help guide the curation of the class
    - ai can generate questions and answers for a particular subject, appears randomly in the feed
        - can be answered or skipped, helps determine user's level of understanding
        - do we gamify somehow?
        - store a list of all the questions a user has done, and the level of understanding they had
        - appears "randomly" in the feed, based on time or topic
    - STRETCH: ai can maybe generate videos???
